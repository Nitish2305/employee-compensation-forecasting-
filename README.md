# ðŸ’¼ Employee Compensation Forecasting Application

## Overview

The **Employee Compensation Forecasting Application** is a data-driven tool built using **Python, SQLite, Pandas, and Matplotlib**. It enables HR teams and business managers to:

- Filter employees based on role, location, and status  
- Analyze compensation across roles and experience levels  
- Simulate percentage-based compensation increments  
- Export customized employee datasets as CSV files  

This project is developed in **Google Colab** for ease of collaboration, analysis, and visualization.



## Key Features (User Stories)

###  User Story 1: Filter and Display Active Employees
- Filter employees by **role** and **location**
- View only **active** employees (based on "Active?" or "status")
- Display average compensation by role
- Visualize using a **bar chart**

### User Story 2: Group Employees by Years of Experience
- Categorize employees into experience ranges:
  - `0â€“1 yrs`, `1â€“2 yrs`, `2â€“5 yrs`, `5â€“10 yrs`, `10â€“20 yrs`, `20+ yrs`
- Count of employees per range
- Optional: breakdown by **Role** or **Location**
- Visualized using **grouped bar charts**

### User Story 3: Simulate Compensation Increments
- Apply a **global % increment** across all employees
- Apply **custom % increments** per employee or location (optional)
- Show current and updated compensation side by side
- Visualized using a **comparison bar chart**

### User Story 4: Export Filtered Employee Data
- Export filtered data to **CSV**
- Columns included: `Name`, `Role`, `Location`, `Experience`, `Compensation`, `Status`
- Export reflects any **applied increments**

## How to Run the Application

### Option 1: Run on Google Colab (Recommended - No Setup Required)

1. **Clone or download** this repository.
2. Open the notebook: [`notebooks/employee_forecasting.ipynb`](notebooks/employee_forecasting.ipynb)  
   Or directly open it in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
3. Upload your own dataset (CSV) or use the included sample from `sample_data/employee_data.csv`.
4. Run each cell in order to:
   - Filter employees by role/location/status
   - Group employees by experience levels
   - Simulate compensation increments
   - Export filtered results to CSV
   - Generate visual insights with charts

 No installation or setup required â€” runs entirely in the browser!


### Option 2: Run Locally with Streamlit (Optional Interactive UI)

Prefer a visual, interactive dashboard? Run it locally with Streamlit:

####  Step-by-Step Setup

1. Make sure **Python 3.7+** is installed
 Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas matplotlib

streamlit run streamlit_app.py
